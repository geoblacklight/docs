# What is GeoBlacklight?

GeoBlacklight is a world-class discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings. It
is an open collaborative project aiming to build off of the successes
of the Blacklight Solr-powered discovery interface and the
multi-institutional OpenGeoportal federated metadata sharing
communities. We're actively looking for [community input and development partners](/guides.html#contributing-to-the-project).
